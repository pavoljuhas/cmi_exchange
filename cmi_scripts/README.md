# CMI Scripts

This is a set of community developed stand-alone Python scripts that use the
DiffPy-CMI packages for a range of data fitting and visualization tasks. These
can be used as tutorial examples or can be adapted to solve a particular
problem you are interested in.

Contents
--------

* [calcbvsnacl](./calcbvsnacl) - Calculate bond valence sums for NaCl
  using standard and custom valence parameters.

* [calcpdfc60](./calcpdfc60) - Calculate and plot a PDF for C60 from a stru
  file. Uses the DebyePDFCalculator from DiffPy-CMI.

* [calcpdfcds](./calcpdfcds) - Calculate and plot a PDF for CdS wurtzite from
  a cif file. Uses the PDFCalculator module from DiffPy-CMI.

* [fitCdSeNP](./fitCdSeNP) - Fit the PDF of CdSe nanoparticles using a
  non-periodic structure model.

* [fitNaClBVS](./fitNaClBVS) - Fit X-ray PDF data from NaCl with a restraint
  for bond valence sums in the structure.

* [fitNiPDF](./fitNiPDF) - Fit a neutron PDF data from nickel using a periodic structure
  model.

* [linearfit](./linearfit) - Perform a simple linear fit to a set of noisy
  data. This script can be run in IPython "demo" mode or as a Jupyter
  notebook.

* [pdfrectprofile](./pdfrectprofile) - Demonstrate definition of custom
  profile for PDF calculation.

More information on Jupyter
---------------------------

Some of the above examples are written as Jupyter notebooks (extension
.ipynb).  A Jupyter notebook creates an interactive computational environment
similar to Mathematica.  To start a Jupyter notebook session, run the command

    jupyter notebook

You can then load the .ipynb file directly into your workspace. Alternatively,
you can run

    jupyter notebook name_of_notebook.ipynb

to load the notebook file directly. You can then interactively run the script
step by step, changing individual parts and updating the result by typing
``Ctrl+Enter``.
